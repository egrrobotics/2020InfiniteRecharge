# 2020 Infinite Recharge

Robot code and documentation for team 5980's FIRST Robotics season, dubbed "Infinite Recharge".

## Notes

Yes, this code is using the deprecated old-style command template, but may be rewritten and upgraded to match the new templates. As of now, the current templates don't make much sense yet, so we will continue using the deprecated template.

On the bright side, we will try to comment and document our code as best as we can to make sure that, in the event of a rewrite, we can re-implement the same functionality using the new template.
